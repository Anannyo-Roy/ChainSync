# ChainSync
Project based on optimizing the chain of supply for tomatoes in light of recent crisis

Connect the headers for the file to work, the main executing code is stored in MainMenu file ie. int main()
Also create a database named as projtest, most of the tables are created in the code itself, so external tables are not required.
Also connections of mysql database and import eigen are needed to be done according to the IDE
